This project is a Rust implementation of a Redis clone, developed as part of the ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

It aims to replicate core Redis functionalities, including event loops and the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).

# Features ‚ú®

This Redis clone supports the following features:
-   **Basic Commands** ‚å®Ô∏è:
    -   `PING`: Checks server responsiveness.
    -   `ECHO`: Returns the provided string.
    -   `SET`: Stores a key-value pair.
    -   `GET`: Retrieves the value associated with a key.
    -   `INCR`: Increments the integer value of a key by one.
    -   `INFO`: Provides information about replication.
    -   `REPLCONF`: Used for replication configuration.
    -   `PSYNC`: Facilitates partial or full resynchronization with a replica.
    -   `WAIT`: Blocks until all previous write commands are successfully transferred and acknowledged by the specified number of replicas.
    -   `CONFIG GET`: Retrieves configuration parameters.
    -   `KEYS`: Returns all keys matching a pattern.
    -   `TYPE`: Returns the string representation of the type of the value stored at key.
    -   `DBSIZE`: Returns the number of keys in the database.
    -   `FLUSHALL`: Removes all keys from all databases.
    -   `COMMAND`: Returns details about all Redis commands.
-   **Transactions** üí≥:
    -   `MULTI`: Marks the start of a transaction block.
    -   `EXEC`: Executes all commands issued after MULTI.
    -   `DISCARD`: Discards all commands issued after MULTI.
-   **Lists** üìù:
    -   `LPUSH`: Inserts elements at the head of a list.
    -   `RPUSH`: Inserts elements at the tail of a list.
    -   `LPOP`: Removes and returns the first element of a list.
    -   `LLEN`: Returns the length of a list.
    -   `LRANGE`: Returns a range of elements from a list.
    -   `BLPOP`: Blocking version of LPOP that waits for elements.
-   **Sorted Sets** üî¢:
    -   `ZADD`: Adds members with scores to a sorted set.
    -   `ZREM`: Removes members from a sorted set.
    -   `ZRANGE`: Returns a range of members from a sorted set by index.
    -   `ZRANK`: Returns the rank of a member in a sorted set.
    -   `ZSCORE`: Returns the score of a member in a sorted set.
    -   `ZCARD`: Returns the number of members in a sorted set.
-   **Geospatial Commands** üåç:
    -   `GEOADD`: Adds geospatial items (longitude, latitude, name) to a sorted set.
    -   `GEODIST`: Returns the distance between two members of a geospatial index.
    -   `GEOPOS`: Returns longitude and latitude of members from a geospatial index.
    -   `GEOSEARCH`: Searches for members within a geospatial index.
-   **Streams** üåä:
    -   `XADD`: Appends a new entry to a stream.
    -   `XRANGE`: Returns a range of entries from a stream.
    -   `XREAD`: Reads entries from one or more streams.
-   **Pub/Sub** üì¢:
    -   `PUBLISH`: Posts a message to a channel.
    -   `SUBSCRIBE`: Subscribes the client to the given channels.
    -   `UNSUBSCRIBE`: Unsubscribes the client from the given channels.
-   **Concurrency** ‚ö°: Utilizes an event loop model to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
-   **RESP Protocol** üó£Ô∏è: Communicates with clients using the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).
-   **Persistence** üíæ: Supports RDB file persistence to save and load data.
-   **Replication** üîÑ: Implements master-replica replication for data redundancy and read scaling.
-   **Pipelining** üöÄ: Supports sending multiple commands without waiting for responses, improving throughput for batch operations.
