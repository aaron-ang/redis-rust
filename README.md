This project is a Rust implementation of a Redis clone, developed as part of the ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

It aims to replicate core Redis functionalities, including event loops and the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).

# Performance Benchmarks üìä

This Redis implementation has been benchmarked against the official Redis server to measure performance characteristics. The benchmarks focus on read throughput using the `memtier_benchmark` tool with configuration guidelines inspired by [Microsoft Azure‚Äôs Redis best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/redis/best-practices-performance).

## Benchmark Configuration

- **Tool**: `memtier_benchmark`
- **Test Duration**: 60 seconds
- **Threads**: 6
- **Connections**: 50 per thread (300 total)
- **Pipeline**: 10 commands
- **Data Size**: 1024 bytes
- **Key Space**: ~1.7M keys
- **Operation**: GET commands (read-heavy workload)

## Results

The latency distribution comparison shows competitive performance between this Rust implementation and the official Redis server:

![Latency by Percentile Distribution](benchmark/read_throughput.png)

**Summary**: For the majority of requests (P0-P99.999), this implementation achieves **lower latency** than the official Redis server, while maintaining similar performance at higher percentiles.

## Running Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks yourself:

```bash
./benchmark/benchmark.sh
```

The script will:
1. Run benchmarks against the official Redis server (baseline)
2. Run benchmarks against this Rust implementation
3. Generate HDR histogram files for detailed latency analysis
4. Output results to the `benchmark/out/` directory
5. Generate a plot of the results using the output `.txt` files: https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html

### Prerequisites

- `redis-cli` installed
- `memtier_benchmark` installed (`brew install memtier_benchmark` on macOS)
- Official Redis server installed (`brew install redis` on macOS)

-   **Transactions** üí≥:
    -   `MULTI`: Marks the start of a transaction block.
    -   `EXEC`: Executes all commands issued after MULTI.
    -   `DISCARD`: Discards all commands issued after MULTI.
-   **Lists** üìù:
    -   `LPUSH`: Inserts elements at the head of a list.
    -   `RPUSH`: Inserts elements at the tail of a list.
    -   `LPOP`: Removes and returns the first element of a list.
    -   `LLEN`: Returns the length of a list.
    -   `LRANGE`: Returns a range of elements from a list.
    -   `BLPOP`: Blocking version of LPOP that waits for elements.

    -   `ZADD`: Adds members with scores to a sorted set.
    -   `ZREM`: Removes members from a sorted set.
    -   `ZRANGE`: Returns a range of members from a sorted set by index.
    -   `ZRANK`: Returns the rank of a member in a sorted set.
    -   `ZSCORE`: Returns the score of a member in a sorted set.
    -   `ZCARD`: Returns the number of members in a sorted set.
-   **Geospatial Commands** üåç:
